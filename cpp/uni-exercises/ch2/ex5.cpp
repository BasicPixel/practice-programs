/* Q5: Newton’s law states that the force, F, between two bodies of masses M_1and M_2 is given by:

F=k((M_1 M_2)/d^2 )
in which k is the gravitational constant and d is the distance between the bodies. The value of k is approximately 6.67*〖10〗^(-8) dyn. cm2/g2. Write a program that prompts the user to input the masses of the bodies and the distance between the bodies. The program then outputs the force between the bodies.
